# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The leaderboard system enables players to submit their scores after completing a game session, view local rankings, and compete with other players through a centralized scoring system. The system integrates with a backend API to maintain persistent global rankings while providing immediate local feedback to players.

## Glossary

- **Game_System**: The main game application that manages gameplay and scoring
- **Leaderboard_API**: The external backend service that provides player score data
- **Player_Session**: A completed game round with an associated score
- **Local_Ranking**: The top 10 players displayed to the current player
- **Score_Submission**: The process of sending player name and score to the backend
- **Name_Prompt**: The UI dialog that requests the player's name after game completion

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to enter my name after finishing a game session, so that my score can be recorded and compared with other players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Player_Session ends, THE Game_System SHALL display a Name_Prompt to collect the player's name
2. THE Name_Prompt SHALL accept text input with a minimum length of 1 character and maximum length of 20 characters
3. WHEN the player submits a valid name, THE Game_System SHALL store the name with the current session score
4. IF the player cancels the Name_Prompt, THEN THE Game_System SHALL not submit the score to the Leaderboard_API
5. THE Name_Prompt SHALL validate that the entered name contains only alphanumeric characters and spaces

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see how my score ranks against the top 10 players, so that I can understand my performance level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a score submission is initiated, THE Game_System SHALL send a GET request to the Leaderboard_API endpoint "/api/leaderboard/top10"
2. THE Game_System SHALL expect a JSON array response containing player records with name and score fields
3. THE Game_System SHALL compare the current player's score against the retrieved top 10 scores
4. IF the current player's score qualifies for the top 10, THEN THE Game_System SHALL determine the appropriate ranking position
5. THE Game_System SHALL display the Local_Ranking showing all top 10 positions with the current player highlighted if included

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want my high score to be saved to the global leaderboard, so that other players can see my achievement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the current player's score qualifies for the top 10, THE Game_System SHALL send a POST request to the Leaderboard_API endpoint "/api/leaderboard/submit"
2. THE Score_Submission SHALL include only the player name and score in JSON format
3. THE Game_System SHALL expect a success status code (200-299) response to confirm score acceptance
4. IF the Game_System receives an error status code, THEN THE Game_System SHALL display an error message to the player
5. THE Game_System SHALL update the Local_Ranking display with the new leaderboard data after successful submission

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see the leaderboard even if my score doesn't make the top 10, so that I can still view the current rankings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the current player's score does not qualify for the top 10, THE Game_System SHALL still display the Local_Ranking
2. THE Local_Ranking SHALL show all 10 positions with player names and scores

4. THE Local_Ranking SHALL include a message indicating the player's current score and position relative to the top 10
5. THE Game_System SHALL provide an option to close the leaderboard display and return to the main game menu

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the leaderboard to handle network failures gracefully, so that I can still enjoy the game when the API is unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Leaderboard_API is unreachable, THE Game_System SHALL display a fallback message indicating network unavailability
2. IF the GET request to retrieve top 10 scores fails, THEN THE Game_System SHALL show only the current player's score
3. IF the POST request to submit a score fails, THEN THE Game_System SHALL offer to retry the submission
4. THE Game_System SHALL implement a timeout of 10 seconds for all Leaderboard_API requests
5. WHEN network requests fail, THE Game_System SHALL log the error details for debugging purposes
